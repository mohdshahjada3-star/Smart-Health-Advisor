# Smart Health Advisor 

Smart Health Advisor is a machine learning–based project developed using Python to predict basic health risk levels.  
The system analyzes patient-related inputs and classifies health risk as Low, Medium, or High.

## Project Summary
This project was built as a learning exercise to understand how machine learning can be applied to healthcare-related problems.  
A dataset of approximately 10,000 patient records was used to train and evaluate the model.

The model achieved an accuracy of around 88.9% on the test data.

## How It Works
- Patient data is taken as input
- The data is preprocessed and cleaned
- A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the dataset
- The trained model predicts the health risk category

## Technology Used
- Python
- Random Forest Classifier (scikit-learn)
- Pandas & NumPy for data handling
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Model Performance
- Dataset size: ~10,000 patient records
- Model accuracy: ~88.9%
- Evaluation performed using train-test split

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical understanding of supervised machine learning
- Experience working with real-world datasets
- Model training, testing, and performance evaluation
- Basic exposure to healthcare data analysis

## Future Scope
- Improve accuracy using better feature selection
- Add a simple web-based user interface
- Deploy the model as a web application
